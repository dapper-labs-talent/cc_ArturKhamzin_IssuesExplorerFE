# QnA

### Planning

> What do you think are the greatest areas of risk in completing the project?

- Learning how to use Github API and its pagination might take much time and there is a risk to not finish functional part (I'm thinking about a repository with big amount of issues: how to filter by issue type if not loaded all of them)

> What changes/additions would you make to the design?

- looks good for MVP

> List a two or three features that you would consider implementing in the future that would add significant value to the project.

- sorting
- filtering by specific user
- switching by layout: tiles (as in wireframes design) or table view
- refactor MVP version and/or address bugs

### Looking Back

> Describe the major design/build decisions and why you made them.

- use create-react-app to bootstrapp project to save time.

> How long did the assignment take (in hours)? Please break down your answer into buckets (e.g. "Learning Framework", "Coding", "Debugging").

- ~6hours in 2 attempts: 4h + ~2h

> If you could go back and give yourself advice at the beginning of the project, what would it be?

- focus on functional part first, don't spend too much time with css, reading github api, thinking about how to design pagination and etc.
- you can start without react-query in the beginning and make it simple

> Did you learn anything new?

- apparently create-react-app already supports `dotenv` out of the box, so next time I would not need to spend time configuring it.

> Do you feel that this assignment allowed you to showcase your abilities effectively?

- I don't think so, due to time constraints. It's like trade-off: either make MVP based on requirements or start project with well-thought architecture. Not always it's possible to use best practices if there is limitation by time.

> Are there any significant web development-related skills that you possess that were not demonstrated in this exercise? If so, what are they?

- debugging issues
- designing REST api
- creating mocks for rest api
- ...
